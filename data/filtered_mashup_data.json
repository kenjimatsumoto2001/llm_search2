The engine runs as a Wordpress plugin for ease of deployment and employs multiple layers of caching (database and flat-file HTML) to maximize site speed. However, most page refreshes will require cached data to be refetched from one or more web service - maximum cache time is between one hour and 12 hours, due to restrictions on caching imposed by web service providers. Still, the results are very consistent, only limited by the accuracy of UPC data provided by third parties - at an estimate, less than 1% of UPC searches have products with wrongly-allocated UPCs. ",

When you are done with this tutorial, you will be able to ask Siri to motivate you and Siri will oblidge by calling you via Twilio to tell you You are Awesome. :) I hope that you take this concept to the next level and dream up interesting things for Siri to do.
